DSPress brings BitClout, Diamond and DeSo features to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Have your WordPress site users and visitors buy your coins and follow you at your DeSo node.

Add BitClout / Diamond / DeSo buttons under the content and BitClout / Diamond / DeSo widgets to your sidebars to send your users to buy your coins and follow you at your DeSo node. The DeSo node can be BitClout.com, DiamondApp.com or any other DeSo node or app.

The buttons and widgets blend in with your theme seamlessly. You can customize the call to action text over the buttons or turn them on/off, as well as use your own call to action text. You can disable the Buttons under content if you wish to use only the Widgets as well.

You can enter the default account to be used in buttons in plugin options page.

In addition, all authors will be able to add their own BitClout / Diamond / DeSo username in their profile to be used for the buttons, so the buttons showing under their posts as well as the author widget in sidebar will go to their BitClout / Diamond / DeSo profile. This feature can be disabled if you wish, from plugin settings, with “Force Site Button instead of Author” option.

DSPress will be bringing an increasing number of DeSo features to your site.

---------------------------

After install, the setup wizard will help you save your DeSo profile in your site to be used in the buttons. This profile will be used for your entire site. Any author whom has his or her own DeSo profile will need to save their profile link in their WP user profile settings so that the plugin can display widgets for them.

You will find the two widgets you can use in your Appearance -> Widgets section. Widgets are customizable

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Follow the setup wizard to save your DeSo profile.
3. Place widgets in your sidebars
4. Done.
